Hint:
1. We need two loop
2. First loop (i) will run from 1 to number of rows we need to create. Suppose if its 5 then loop should run from 1 to 5+1.
3. Second loop will run from 1 to (i + 1). for example in first run value of i is 1, so the loop become 1 to 2, so it will print 1 star.
4. for example in second run value of i is 2, so the loop become 1 to 3, so it will print 2 star and so on till loop reaches 5+1.
